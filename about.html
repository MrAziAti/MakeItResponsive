      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
      <div class="inova">
      <p>We in <b>Inova</b> want to make goods, products and technology easily accessible to everyone.
        To reach this goal we are frequently hosting innovation camps to share our experience and the information
        we have acquired over the years, with both companies and regular people. Our company is <i>new</i>, however
        the team has a lot of expertise and knowledge when it comes to this field of activity. We want to teach
        everyone that including and supporting developing countries, and producing substitutes to products that benefit
        the people living in these countries is the way to go.</p>

      <div class="maintext"><p>There are a millions upon millions of people living in poverty or with low income. This <i>however</i>
        doesn't mean companies should take these markets for granted but instead see it as an <b>opportunity</b> to create
        or improve products that matter. <b>Inova</b> wants to connect the world through innovation and invite companies
        to learn about the positive effects of co-creation and communication between developed and undeveloped countries.</p>
        <p><b>Inova</b> wants everyone to understand the strengths and opportunities connected to frugal
        innovation. To achieve our goals we need companies to be on the same page as us, and we would like to invite
        <i>anyone</i> who wants to grow their market and company through frugal innovation to join our camps. We
        hope this sounds interesting and that you could get in touch with us.</p></div>
